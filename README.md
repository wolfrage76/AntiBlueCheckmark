# AntiBlueCheckmark
Auto hide Twitter Blue Checks with under 10k followers from your timeline

Not yet published to the Chrome Extension store yet till I make some icons as required, but you can manually use it with these directions (Don't worry, it's very simple!):

Step 1 - download the .zip file here:  

[Anti-BlueCheckmark.zip](https://github.com/wolfrage76/AntiBlueCheckmark/files/11327443/Anti-BlueCheckmark.zip)

Step 2 - extract the contents
Right click on the downloaded zip file, then click "Extract Here".

Step 3 - open the extension page in google chrome
  There are several ways todo that.

  Option 1: type chrome://extensions in the url bar and press enter.

  Option 2: click on the tree dots in the top right of the browser, then click "More tools" then click "Extensions".

Step 4 - activate developer mode
Turn on the switch on the top right of the page that says "Developer mode"

Step 5 - load unpacked extension
Click on the button on the top left of the page that says "Load unpacked".

Then select a folder that contains the manifest.json file.

That's it!  Now you shouldn't see Verified accounts with under 10K followers.  I will work on adding an Option to set your own follower limit.
